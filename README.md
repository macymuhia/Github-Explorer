## Description
Github Explorer is an application that allows users to search for users on github using the github username.
## Project Behaviour
* A user can view the default user profile which is my profile (macymuhia)
* A user can search for a user on github by typing the username on the search bar
* A custom directive enables the highlight of the repository container on hover
* A user can view the searched username, profile picture and the repositories of the searched user
* A user can be directed to the searched user's github profile by clicking on the searched user's username
* A user can be directed to the searched user's repository by clicking on the specific repository name.

## Technologies Used
